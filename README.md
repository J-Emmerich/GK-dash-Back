1. You can save invoices and download as PDF
2. A client/CRM database where to save contracts and other client-related files and data #todo
3. Any user can have any amount of projects users can invite other to their project and share files/data. #todo

The backend is built in Node.js, it uses Puppetter for the pdf rendering, Express for the server/routing. MongoDB and Mongoose for the data. Authentication with JWT. Is built with clean-architecture in mind. I'm working now to make it more stable and secure, get a good log system and gracefully deal with errors.
